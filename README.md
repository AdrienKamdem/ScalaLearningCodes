# ScalaLearningCodes

## here is the evolution of my scala skills I am currently learning 

In this folder you can have an overview on different little 
algorithms I'm doing by myself. They are simple but enable me to deep understanding 
scala notion that are in some ways different from other programming languages. 

Scala is one of the most use programming language in big data. That's why I'm learning it. 
It is particularly good at analyzing large sets of data without any significant impact on 
performance and thus Scala is being adopted by many developers and data scientists.
